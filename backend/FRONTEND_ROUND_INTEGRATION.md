# Frontend integration: live matching and swipes

Base API URL in development: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api`.

For every protected request, send:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The backend is the source of truth for matching time, phase changes, and the
current opponent. The frontend must never decide that a round has ended or call
an endpoint to force the next round.

## 1. Check into a room

After login, check the participant into their QR-selected room:

```http
PATCH /api/room
Content-Type: application/json

{ "room_id": 1 }
```

## 2. Start an event (admin UI only)

Only show this control to the event host/admin. The backend enforces this role
regardless of what the UI displays.

```http
POST /api/room/1/start-event
```

A normal user receives `403`. An already-started room returns `409`.

## 3. Poll the current round

While the matching screen is open, poll every 5–10 seconds:

```http
GET /api/room/1/current-round
```

Every event round has a 180-second conversation and a 15-second transition.
Polling also catches the room up if a device sleeps or a user returns later.

```json
{
  "room_id": 1,
  "phase": "active",
  "transition_seconds": 15,
  "round": {
    "id": 12,
    "number": 2,
    "duration_seconds": 180,
    "started_at": "2026-08-12T14:30:00+00:00",
    "expires_at": "2026-08-12T14:33:00+00:00",
    "seconds_remaining": 121
  },
  "pairing": {
    "id": 44,
    "is_bye": false,
    "opponent": { "id": 9, "name": "Asha" }
  },
  "next_round_number": 3,
  "event_completed": false
}
```

Render by phase:

- `active`: show `pairing.opponent`, swipe controls, and a countdown to
  `round.expires_at`. `is_bye: true` means show a sit-out state instead.
- `transition`: `pairing` is `null`. Show “Please move to your next match” and
  the countdown. Do not display the next opponent yet.
- `completed`: stop polling and show the post-event review screen.

Update the visual countdown locally once per second, calculated from
`round.expires_at`; use every polling response to correct it. If `round.id`
changes, reset the matching-screen state immediately.

## 4. Save a swipe decision

During an active round, use its `pairing.id`:

```http
POST /api/pairings/44/swipe
Content-Type: application/json

{ "decision": "accept" }
```

Allowed values are `accept` and `reject`. The same request can be sent again
with the other value to update the decision. The backend deliberately keeps
decisions editable, including after the event; the frontend should hide or
disable editing after the matching UI ends.

Do not send a swipe when `pairing` is `null` or `is_bye` is `true`.

## 5. Show the final review

When `event_completed` is `true`, request:

```http
GET /api/swipes
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "pairing_id": 44,
      "round_number": 2,
      "room_id": 1,
      "opponent": { "id": 9, "name": "Asha" },
      "decision": "accept"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use this list to show the people the user accepted/rejected. “Finalize” is a UI
action only at present: it must not call a special backend endpoint and does
not lock the stored decisions.

## Error handling

- `401`: missing or expired login token; redirect to login.
- `403`: user lacks admin privileges or is not in the requested room.
- `404`: requested pairing does not belong to the user, or it does not exist.
- `409`: event has not started, or the event was already started by an admin.
- `400`: invalid swipe decision or attempt to swipe a bye.
